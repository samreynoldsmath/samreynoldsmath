Hi, I'm Sam. I am a PhD student at Portland State University studying computational mathematics. 

My primary area of focus is finite element methods for partial differential equations. 
In collaboration with my advisor [Jeffrey Ovall](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/jeffovall/home),
I am currently developing 
[PuncturedFEM](https://github.com/samreynoldsmath/PuncturedFEM) which allows for curvilinear mesh cells with holes.

My other interests include numerical optimization, graph theory, and dynamical systems. 
Current side projects are [shape optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_optimization) (especially for fluids), 
[minimum rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_rank_of_a_graph) problems,
and [home primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_prime).

My current favorite langauge is Python; also familiar with C, C++, and MATLAB. One day I would like to learn Julia and Rust.
