# Sam Reynolds' GitHub Page

Hi, I'm Sam. I am a PhD student at Portland State University studying computational mathematics. 

My primary area of focus is finite element methods for partial differential equations. 
In collaboration with my advisor [Jeffrey Ovall](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/jeffovall/home),
I am currently developing 
[PuncturedFEM](https://github.com/samreynoldsmath/PuncturedFEM) which allows for curvilinear mesh cells with holes.

My other interests include numerical optimization, graph theory, and dynamical systems. 
Current side projects are 
[shape optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_optimization), 
[minimum rank problems](https://github.com/samreynoldsmath/msr),
and [home primes](https://github.com/samreynoldsmath/homeprime).

I am most familiar with Python, C, C++, and MATLAB. One day I would like to learn Julia and Rust.
